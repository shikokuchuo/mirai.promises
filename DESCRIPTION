Title: Make 'Mirai' 'Promises'
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Description: Allows 'mirai' objects encapsulating asynchronous computations,
    from the 'mirai' package by Gao (2023) <doi:10.5281/zenodo.7912722>, to be
    used interchangeably with 'promise' objects from the 'promises' package by
    Cheng (2021) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=promises>. This facilitates
    their use with packages 'plumber' by Schloerke and Allen (2022)
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plumber> and 'shiny' by Cheng, Allaire,
    Sievert, Schloerke, Xie, Allen, McPherson, Dipert and Borges (2022)
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny>.
